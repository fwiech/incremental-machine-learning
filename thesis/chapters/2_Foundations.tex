\section{Tools}

\subsection*{Python}

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
It is built for Rapid Application Development with easy to learn syntax for readability.
Key features are built in data structures, dynamic typing and binding.
\cite{python-lang}
It has its own package manager called "Python Package Index (PyPi)".
The language is compiled at execution and is available for all major platforms without charge.
The programming language is open source and maintained by the Pthon Software Foundation.
\cite{python-software-foundation}


\subsection*{NumPy}

NumPy is a package for Python.
It enables scientific computing with N-dimensional array objects and supports array broadcasting, type casting and basic linear algebra functions.
\cite{numpy-package}


\subsection*{Tensorflow}

Tensorflow is an entire ecosystem for solving problems with machine learning.
It is developed and maintained by the Google Brain team.
In 2015 it was released unser the Apache 2.0 open-source license.
It offers multiple levels of abstraction for building, training and testing models.
Visualisations of the code and intuitive debugging allow the deeloper more flexibility.
Large machine learning training tasks can be done with distributed training on different hardware configurations without changing the model definition.
Trained models can be directly put into production.
Moreover, Tensorflow offers support for multiple languages and platforms.
\cite{tensorflow-about}

\subsubsection*{Core Concepts}

Tensorflow consists of a server client architecture.
The core is located on the server side and developed in C++.
Developers use client liberaries in different languages to interact with the core.
The general architecture for developers of Tensorflow is shown in figure \ref{fig:tensorflow_programming_environment_image}.

    \caption{\cite{tensorflow_programming_environment_image} Tensorflow programming environment}
    \label{fig:tensorflow_programming_environment_image}
\end{figure}

The most important concept for developers is the dataflow graph functionality.
All variables, constants and operations form a computation graph.
Parts of the graph can be started and calculated across a set of local and remote devices.
Figure \ref{fig:tensorflow_graph_image} shows an example of a computation graph:

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\section{MNIST Dataset}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics{mnist_100_digits}
    \caption{\cite{mnist_examples_image} Examples of handwritten digits in the mnist dataset}
    \label{fig:mnist_examples}
\end{figure}

The MNIST database is a public available dataset of handwritten digits.
It contains a set of 70,000 entities split into 60,000 training and 10,000 test parts.
The digits are size-normalized and centered photos with a fixed-size of 28 by 28 pixels.
The numbers are created by approximately 250 writers. 
\cite{mnist-database}
The Dataset pertains to one of the most popular datasets for research and testing the performance of new networks.
It is a great resource for testing new deep learning algorithms with supervised learning.


\section{Deep Neural Network}
\label{foundations_deep_neural_network}

The Introduction gave a basic overview of the understanding and behind the scenes of a neural network.
This section shows the construct and math of the network used for the elastic weight consolidation implementation and scenario testing.

As described, a neural network is a collection of neurons connected with weights and paired together in layers.
Each neuron receives values from all neurons on the layer before.
Each connection holds a value which represents the importance.
Therefore, this connected value is called weight.
The neuron computes all the input values (x) with the weights (w) and applies a bias (b) to predict the result (y).
Figure \ref{fig:dnn_node_procedure} shows the computation structure of each neuron in the network.
\cite{math_nn_skalski}

            (w3) {$w_3$};

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{\cite{dnn_neuron_basic_overview} Neuron computation structure}
    \label{fig:dnn_node_procedure}
\end{figure}

The value of each output neuron can be calculated as the following \cite{medium_nn_from_scratch}:

\begin{equation}
y = b + \sum_{i} x_i w_i
\end{equation}

To be able to ensure the quickest calculation possible, vectorisation and matrixes are used.
All Weights on a layer get stacked to a matrix W together.
The same process is applied to the biases on each layer.
This results in the following calculation
\cite{medium_nn_from_scratch}:

\begin{equation}
X = [ x_1 \dots x_i ]; \space W = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_{11} & \dots  & x_{1j} \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    x_{i1} & \dots  & x_{ij}
\end{bmatrix}; \space
B = [ b_1 \dots b_j ]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    Y = X * W + B
\end{equation}

Finally, the result of this calculation is passed through an activation function.
This activation function is the key element of a neural network.
Without it, a neural network would just be a combination of linear functions, which can be combined into one linear function.
The activation function modifies the result in a probabilistic way.
Important to mention is, that the activation function has a significant impact on the speed of learning.
The network in this article uses the ReLU as an activation function for the hidden layers \cite{math_nn_skalski,relu}:

\begin{equation}
    ReLU(x) = max(0,x)
\end{equation}

The output of the last layer will be computed as logits:
$$logits = (x*w)+b$$

On the output layer it uses the softmax function, which connects the output classes in a probabilistic way:

\begin{equation}
    Softmax : \mathbb{R}^K \to \mathbb{R}^K
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    Softmax(x)_i : \frac{e^{k_i}}{\sum_{k=1}^K e^{x_k}}
\space ; i = 1, …, K
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    probabilities = Softmax(logits)
\end{equation}

After a prediction by the calculation of all neurons and layers the network needs source of information on the progress of the learning process.
This is where the loss function is introduced.
It is designed to show how bad the classification to the right solution is.
In this article the crossentropy loss function is used.
\cite{math_nn_skalski, medium_nn_from_scratch}

\begin{equation}
    CrossEntropy(p,y) = -\sum_{i=1}^K y_i \log(p_i)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    loss = CrossEntropy(probabilities, y)
\end{equation}

This process of calculating a result of the network is called forward propagation.
Within this process, the network calculates a result based on the inputs.
This is happening due to the parameters and functions of the network.
On this output the learning process gets applied.
This shows the accuracy of the network.
\cite{math_nn_skalski, medium_nn_from_scratch}
\newline
In the learning is the dataset split into multiple batches. These batches include a fixed number of samples from the dataset. The joining of samples enables a much faster learning process.
The learning process is about adapting the weights and biases to optimise the accuracy.
This is done by minimising the loss function.
This process of the update of weights and biases is called Backpropagation.
It is an algorithm which calculates error gradients with respect to each network variable.
Those gradients are later used in an optimization algorithm called Gradient Descent.
This method is used to find a function minimum.
After the minimum is found, it would be applied to all parameters in the network.
By adjusting the learning rate of backpropagation, the developer has the control over the value adjustment.
He defines how detailed each learning step should be.
\cite{math_nn_andrey}
\newline
Iterating the Gradient Descent algorithm several times over different examples will most likely result in a properly trained neural network.

\section{Catastrophic Forgetting}
\label{catastrophic_forgetting}

Catastrophic Forgetting is an affect that happens, when a trained network gets retrained with a new dataset.
This dataset could include complete new classes (disjoint MNIST) or the same classes with new information (permuted MNIST).
The effect is that the network completely forgets the information learned in the dataset before.
\newline
To show this effect in use, Figure \ref{fig:catastrophic_forgetting_d91_example} and Figure \ref{fig:catastrophic_forgetting_d55_example} present catastrophic forgetting in the two benchmarks D9-1 and D5-5.
\newline
The network is built with 784 inputs, 3 hidden layer with 800 neurons and 10 output classes.
Each task trained with a learning rate of 0.001, 2,500 iterations and an batch size of 100.
\newline
Figure \ref{fig:catastrophic_forgetting_d91_example} shows the D9-1 benchmark. After the $T_1$ training, is the accuracy at 95.62\% for $T_1$. In the second task happens the catastrophic fogetting and at the end has $T_1$ 0\% accuracy.

    \caption{Catastrophic forgetting D9-1 example}
    \label{fig:catastrophic_forgetting_d91_example}
\end{figure}

\newpage

In Figure \ref{fig:catastrophic_forgetting_d55_example} is the MNIST dataset split up into two tasks with each five classes.
The graph shows that after the training of task $T_1$, the accuracy of the complete set at 50\%.
After the training start of task $T_2$, the accuracy of $T_1$ drops to zero.
The complete set can just predict 50\%.

% TODO ausbauen | (not but), Nun soll es…
Catastrophic forgetting was first discovered by McCloskey and Cohen in 1989.
They documented their research in the article "Catastrophic Intereference" \cite{psychology_learning_mccloskey_cohen} and explained the problem in a rather simplified version:
Figure \ref{fig:catastrophic_forgetting_clarification}A shows a reprensentation of a network in a simplified form.
It has stored the facts $5 + 4 = 9$ and $6 + 4 = 10$.
\hfill \break
Now this network wants to learn new facts.
Figure \ref{fig:catastrophic_forgetting_clarification}B shows the appendix of the new fact $7 + 4 = 11$.
To be able to learn this fact it is represented seperate to the representation of other facts.
This storing of facts does not disrupt the representation of previous learned knowledge.
\hfill \break
But in a neural network the representation is quite different.
All weights are involved in responding to many different inputs.
To be able to predict the additional new desired outcome, it has to adjust the weights.
This process will alter the network's response to the other input patterns.
It results in changing weights to encode new information and alters previously learned responses to other inputs.

\section{Elastic Weight Consolidation}
\label{foundation_ewc}

In order to overcome this catastrophic forgetting or at least reduce it, a team of researchers published a white paper called "Overcoming catastrophic forgetting" in 2016.
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation}

At first they analysed the human brain as well as animal brains.
Here they discovered that the mammalian brain may avoid catastrophic forgetting by protecting previously-acquired knowledge.
They developed an algorithm for deep neural networks, which they call Elastic Weight Consolidation.
By showing uses in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, several tasks could sequentially trained without forgetting older ones.
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation}

According to their paper many configurations of $\theta$ (set of weights and biases) will result in the same performance of the network.
This is a crucial information for EWC.
Its goal is to over-parametersize $\theta$ and find a solution for $\theta$ at the next task.
This solution needs to be close to the previous task solution of $\theta$.
While learning the next task, EWC wants to protect the performance of the previous task by limiting the parameters.
They should stay in a given region for a low error of the previous task.
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation}

To determine which values are most important, they see the training from a probabilistic perspective.
Here they discovered, that the catastrophic forgetting does not happen in a fully Bayesian way.
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation}

The Bayes theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event \cite{Bayes_theorem}. \cite{elastic-weight-consolidation, schaeffer_ewc}
\newline
The dataset as $\mathcal{D}$ with included samples is given.
Now the network has to find the conditional probability for $\theta$, in fact the likelihood of the parameter (weights and biases) in $\theta$ given the data from the dataset.
This conditional probability $p \left(\theta | \mathcal{D} \right)$ is and calculated using the Bayes' rule: \cite{elastic-weight-consolidation, schaeffer_ewc}

\begin{equation}
    p \left( \theta | \mathcal{D} \right) = \frac{p \left(\mathcal{D}|\theta\right) p\left(\theta\right)}{p \left( \mathcal{D} \right)}
\end{equation}

$p \left( \theta \right)$ and $p \left( \mathcal{D} \right)$ are marginal probabilities. These are the probabilities for each event independently.
\newline
If the log-transform gets applied, the equation writes as follows: \cite{elastic-weight-consolidation, schaeffer_ewc}

\begin{equation}
    \setlength{\jot}{5pt}
    \begin{split}
        \log p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) & = \log \left[ 
                \frac{p \left(\mathcal{D}|\theta\right) p\left(\theta\right)}{p \left( \mathcal{D} \right)} 
            \right]
        \\
        & = \log p(\mathcal{D} | \theta) + \log p(\theta) - \log p(\mathcal{D})
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:bayes_applied_log}
\end{equation}

The paper assumes now that the data is split into two independent parts. $\mathcal{D}_A$ for task A and data $\mathcal{D}_B$ for task B.
This would work with more than two tasks, but for simplicity are only two used.
The re-arragne of the equation is: \cite{elastic-weight-consolidation, schaeffer_ewc}

\begin{equation}
    \setlength{\jot}{5pt}
    \begin{split}
        \log p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) 
        & = \log \big[
                p(\mathcal{D}_A | \theta) p(\mathcal{D}_B | \theta)
                \big]
            + \log p(\theta)
            - \log \big[
                p(\mathcal{D}_A) p(\mathcal{D}_B) 
             \big]
        \\
        & = \log p(\mathcal{D}_B | \theta)
            + \log p(\mathcal{D}_A | \theta)
            + \log p(\theta)
            - \log p(\mathcal{D}_A)
            - \log p(\mathcal{D}_B)
        \\
        & = \log p(\mathcal{D}_B | \theta)
            - \log p(\mathcal{D}_B)
            + \big[
                \log p(\mathcal{D}_A | \theta)
                + \log p(\theta)
                - \log p(\mathcal{D}_A)
                \big]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

This last re-arragement looks with the term in the brackets familiar with Formula \eqref{eq:bayes_applied_log}, except $\mathcal{D}$ is replaced by $\mathcal{D}_A$ task A.
Since they are equivalent to the conditional probability of the network's parameters given taskA's data, the equation can be modified to: \cite{elastic-weight-consolidation, schaeffer_ewc}

\begin{equation}
    \log p(\theta | \mathcal{D})=
       \log p(\mathcal{D}_B | \theta)
     + \log p(\theta | \mathcal{D}_A)
     - \log p(\mathcal{D}_B)
    \label{eq:bayesian_modified}
\end{equation}

Interesting on this formula is, that it still calculates the entire dataset (left side of Formula \eqref{eq:bayesian_modified}). Moreover, the paper descibes, that the right hand side only depends on the loss function for task B $\log p(\mathcal{D}_B | \theta)$. All information about task A is absorbed into the conditional probability $\log p(\theta | \mathcal{D}_A)$, the posterior distribution.
So the paper follows that this conditional probability contains information about which parameters are important in solving task A.
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation, schaeffer_ewc}
\newline
They state, that the true posterior distribution is intractable and follow with the Laplace approximation to approximate the posterior as a Gaussian distribution with mean given by the parameters of the previous task A and the diagonal precision by the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix.
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation}
\newline
Moreover, they inform that the Fisher information matrix is equivalent to the second derivative of the loss near a minimum and that "…it can be computed from first-order derivatives alone and is thus easy to calculate even for large models…" \cite{elastic-weight-consolidation} and "…it is guaranteed to be positive semi-definite."
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation}.
\cite{elastic-weight-consolidation, schaeffer_ewc}
\newline
As a result they propose the new loss function for the upcoming training of task B:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathcal{L}^{CE}(\theta) + \sum_{i} \frac{\lambda}{2} F_{i} (\theta_{i} - \theta_{A,i}^{*})^2
\end{equation}

The loss $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ for task B consists of the originial loss $\mathcal{L}^{CE}(\theta)$ and the EWC appendix.
Lambda ($\lambda$) in the EWC appendix is a factor that determines how important the old task is compared to the new one \cite{elastic-weight-consolidation}.
The parameter $i$ is the iterator for each parameter (weights and biases) of the matrices.
The parameter F is the Fisher Information Matrix, which looks like this \cite{incremental-moment-matching}:

\begin{equation}
    F_{ij} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L} \left( x_n \right) }{\partial \theta_{i}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L} \left( x_n \right) }{\partial \theta_{j}}
\end{equation}

In this function N are all training samples, $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function and $\theta$ is the set of all weights and biases.
In the paper the authors show some results with their algorithm on three different tasks with supervised learning. Figure \ref{fig:ewc_permuted_example} shows three permuted MNIST tasks:
